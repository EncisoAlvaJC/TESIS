poblaci\'on \cite{Intercensal15}

\item Posible relaci\'on trastornos del sue\~no y DC en la vejez
\cite{Amer13,Miyata13,Potvin12}

\item Epidemiolog\'ia del DC en Hidalgo: eficiencia del sue\~no\cite{VazquezTagle16}

\item DFA en registros de PSG \cite{Valeria}: exponente de Hurst diferente en sujetos 
con y sin DC 

\item Se buscan marcadores cl\'inicos para el diagn\'ostico de DC

\subsection{Objetivos}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Pregunta de investigaci\'on}
\textbf{
¿Es posible que la caracterizaci\'on de registros de PSG como series de tiempo d\'ebilmente 
estacionarias, pueda ser usada como un marcador en el diagn\'ostico cl\'inico de PDC en adultos 
mayores?

\begin{itemize}
\item Estudiar la definici\'on de estacionariedad y sus consecuencias en un modelo

\item Investigar c\'omo detectar si una serie de tiempo dada proviene de un proceso
d\'ebilmente estacionario

\item Usando los an\'alisis hallados, determinar si los datos considerados provienen de 
procesos débilmente estacionarios.
Revisar si esta informaci\'on muestra diferencias entre sujetos con y sin PDC

\section{Resultados}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Resultados principales}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cada \'epoca fue clasificada 'posiblemente estacionaria' (PE) no se rechaza la 
hip\'otesis de estacionariedad ($\alpha < 0.05$) en PSR

\item Debido a la variabilidad entre sujetos, se consider\'o la proporci\'on de \'epocas PE
en cada etapa
\begin{equation*}
\text{\% \'epocas PE} = \frac{\text{\# \'epocas PE en MOR}}{\text{\# \'epocas en MOR}}
\end{equation*}

\item Las proporciones se compararon:
\begin{itemize}
\item MOR vs NMOR (individual y grupal)
\item Grupo Control vs Grupo PDC (en cada etapa de sue\~no)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
